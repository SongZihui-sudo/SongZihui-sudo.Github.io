##  1. <a name='Findabusinessmodelbyusingdesignthinkingorleanstartup'></a>1. Find a business model by using design thinking or lean startup

For a example. If i have an good an good idea, I will start my project with Lean Startup,else I will start my project with design thinking. So If I choose first, I will incorporation(**yin kao po rui shen**) of user needs through early and continuous hypothesis(**hai pa ze sei si**) testing.As a result.My bussiness model will be a Robust & efficient & fastly gained business model, Central focus. If I choose behind,  I will incorporation of user needs with Qualitative methods.My bussiness model will be Testable prototype and no Central focus.In the last, I think open source community will become a widely business model for individual developer.

##  2. <a name='DescribeanlMSwiththethreemanagementsystemstoyourproject.'></a>2. Describe an lMS with the three management systems to your project.

**An Integrated(in te gui rui de) Management System (IMS)** integrates all of an organization’s systems and processes into one complete framework,  enabling an organization to work as a single unit with unified  objectives.

First of all.It is environmental management.

Their Environmental Objectives include:

1. To monitor targets for energy, water, and waste reduction(rui da ke shen) in our offices,
2. To champion environmental and sustainability(**se si bi na bi le ti**) initiatives(**yi li ti li fu si**) that reduce our  environmental impact; encouraging others in our communities and sharing  what we learn along the way,
3. To support positive environmental changes throughout the New Zealand Electricity Supply Industry,
4. To create a company culture of environmental awareness and sustainability.

Second of all. It is safety production management.

They believe that technology can help improve safety in our cars as well  as in our workplace. EHS is engaged with engineering so our products are more ergonomically(e ge nao mi kou le) friendly to build and install.And making safety production more perfect. Design principles(pu run sen po si) and standards have been established between ergonomics, production and  engineering so safety is built into the design process from the initial  stages.

Third of all It is occupational(a kei pei shen nou) health management.[more detail](https://teslaec.com/policy/4-occupatinal-health-management-policy)

1. TESLA ENGINEERING is committed to encouraging Medical checkups, pre-employment and on regular bases.
2. TESLA ENGINEERING is keen to provide respectable Medical lnsurance of good coverage to all its staff.
3. TESLA ENGINEERING is highly committed to the wellbeing of its stafl and to avoid all chronic and acute health  effects to staff and contractors.

##  3. <a name='DescribethestructureofIMS'></a>3. Describe the structure of IMS

An Integrated(**in te gui rui de**) Management System (IMS) combines all aspects of an organisation’s systems, processes and Standards into one smart system. Like EMS add QMS add SMS.(IMS = EMS + QMS + SMS). The IMS describes the process-oriented structure of a company(leadership, core and supporting processes).

##  4. <a name='QualityGoals'></a>4. Quality Goals

[more detail](https://teslaec.com/policy/3-quality-policy)

1. Deliver on-time and on-quality products, systems and services that meet or exceed(**yi ke sei de**) our customer's expectations.
2. ldentify and understand our customer's  expectations, measure customer perceptions(**po sa pu shen**), and implement(**in pu li men te**) improvements  to increase customer satisfaction.
3. Enable and engage our people at all  levels in a relentless drive to improve operational performance along  the value chain from suppliers to customers.
4. lncrease the motivation and skills of  our people to add value to our customers and our businesses, through  continual training and development.
5. Leverage(**lai wo ei zhi**) our partners and suppliers'  strengths to improve our products and our businesses from product design through production, installation and operation.
6. Embed social responsibility and company ethics(**ai sai ke si**) policies in our business practices.
7. Continually improve environmental, health and safety performance through all products, operations, systems and services.
8. Provide a value for money service.
9. Maintain an effectively trained staff and management.
10. Make a profitable return on our activities in order to fund ongoing development and growth.
11. lmprove efficiency through improvements in productivity.

As we all know about The Qms is included that Act,Plan,Check and Do.The act is about Quality Improvement ,the plan is about the Quality planning, the Do is about the Quality steering, and the Check is about the Quality Security.

1. The model of a process-oriented QMS according to DIN EN ISO 9001: 2008 – CUSTOMER VIEW **P64**  
![img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77034643/167302468-5d6af8e1-2142-4653-8f63-7a6cc8c58ab0.png)     
In the Customer View,We can see that The deming circle is contain Act,Check,Do,Plan.Customers pull some requirements.And then We will make some ways to improve the customer statisfation.(Fully understand customer needs, Classification and grading of customer needs by the customer service center, Communication Skills for Customer Satisfaction).Accounding the plan and check,We will back to the do(product) Last We output a good project.  
**Customer focus**   
Organizations depend on their customers and therefore should understand current and future customer needs, should meet customer requirements and strive to exceed customer expectations.   
**Leadership**   
Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization. They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization’s objectives.
Involvement of people People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization’s benefit.  
**Process approach**   
A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.  
**System approach to management**   
Identifying, understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization’s effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its objectives.  
**Continual improvement**   
Continual improvement of the organization’s overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.  
**Factual approach to decision making**   
Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.  
**Mutually beneficial supplier relationships**   
An organization and its suppliers are interdependent and a mutually beneficial
relationship enhances the ability of both to create value." (ISO 9000:2000-12, 7)

**Plan:**   
The first is Plan. Recognize an opportunity and plan a change.  
**Do:**  
The second of all is Do. Test the change. Carry out a small-scale study.  
Check: Review the test, analyze the results, and identify what you’ve learned.  
**Act:**   
The third of all is Act. Take action based on what you learned in the study step. If the change did not work, go through the cycle again with a different plan. If you were successful, incorporate what you learned from the test into wider changes. Use what you learned to plan new improvements, beginning the cycle again.  
5. The model of a process-oriented QMS according to DIN EN ISO 9001: 2015 **P68**

**Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle**   
he PDCA cycle can be briefly described as follows:  
**Plan:**  
establish the objectives of the system and its processes, and the resources needed to deliver results in accordance with customers' requirements and the organization's policies, and identify and address risks and opportunities;  
**Do:**  
implement what was planned;
— Check: monitor and (where applicable) measure processes and the resulting products and services against policies, objectives, requirements and planned activities, and report the results;  
**Act:**   
take actions to improve performance, as necessary.
FIRST,we will accept customer's requirements about the product..We will plan.and then We proessing it.In the peocess,We will improve our product accouning to the customer's satisfaction or requirements.In the last step,We will check out product.And then go back to the product.
##  6. <a name='ToolsandinstrumentsinQMS.'></a>6. Tools and instruments in QMS.

The first is Kano-Model.We can use it to analyze expectations and requirements of the customer.And it contain with Basic factors Performance factors Enthusiasm(**en se si ya ze mu**) factors.The Kano-Model describes the relationship between requirements of customer and their satisfaction.

The second is Instruments for error detection  Collective error list (**P74**) and Histogram(**hei si te ge ruai mu**)(**P75**) and Instruments for error analysis Pareto Analysis(**P76**) ,Cause-and-effect diagram (Ishikawa diagram) and EPIA Analysis (FMEA; see project management).

Ishikawa diagram(**P78**)

##  7. <a name='Environmentalaspectsandprinciples'></a>7. Environmental aspects and principles

For the EMS the standards families ISO 14000 and EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) are used.
EMAS is valid within the EU, while ISO 14001 is valid worldwide. EMAS regulations are stricter(**si zhuai ke te**).
EMS requires extensive documentation. It serves as a proof in an environmental audit. This audit shows if the EMS works.
Fundamentals of the EMS are three principles:

Principle of precautionary(**po ka  shen nai rui**) (Vorsorgeprinzip)
Principle of welfare (**wao rui fei er**)(Fürsorgeprinzip)
Principle of cooperation

##  8. <a name='ModelofanEnvironmentalManagementSystemd.SafetyManagementSystem'></a>8. Model of an Environmental Management Systemd. Safety Management System
Representation of the EMS according to EMAS **P88**   
![img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77034643/167304271-ef184a70-2903-432e-a653-3e3b15e351f5.png)    
[相关页面](https://www.epa.gov/ems/learn-about-environmental-management-systems)   
An Environmental Management System (EMS) is a framework that helps an organization achieve its environmental goals through consistent review, evaluation, and improvement of its environmental performance. The assumption is that this consistent review and evaluation will identify opportunities for improving and implementing the environmental performance of the organization. The EMS itself does not dictate a level of environmental performance that must be achieved; each organization's EMS is tailored to its own individual objectives and targets.

##  9. <a name='GoalsinSafetyManagementSystem'></a>9. Goals in Safety Management System

The objective of a Safety Management System is to provide a structured  management approach to control safety risks in operations. Effective safety managementmust take into account the organisation’s specific structures and processes related to safety of operations.

##  10. <a name='whatisquality'></a>10. what is quality?

Quality refers to how good something is compared to other similar things. In other words, its degree of excellence(**ai ke se len si**).

The nature of goods and services describes this term. Quality products have no defects, damages or errors and thus do not lead to complaints(**ken pu len ci**).

DIN EN ISO 8402 describes quality as the totality of features of a unit in terms of their suitability(**sui te bi le ti**) to meet specified requirements. This type of quality is standardized by
means of a QMS, so that the quality is secured permanently.

##  11. <a name='Whichprinciplesareimportantinqualitymanagement'></a>11. Which principles are important in quality management?

1. Customer focus
2. Leadership
3. Engagement of people
4. Process approach

5. The Development of Total Quality Management
6. Beyond Total Quality Management

##  13. <a name='Whatcriticismisthereforthetraditionalapproachofmanagement'></a>13. What criticism is there for the traditional approach of management?

Conversely, Mintzberg (1994), one of the biggest critics of prescriptive approach developed the emergent approach to strategic management. He states that in emergent strategies the final objective is unclear and it a process of evolution, adaption, alternation and continuity. Emergent strategies are more successful in this chaotic world as they are unintentional and are the result of impromptu response to unforeseen situations which emerge over time. For example, Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, decision to open his second store in a rural area rather than a big city, for convenience of logistics and management efficiency was a fantastic winning emergent strategy. Also as there was less competition and people would travel to buy products which offered value at the lowest prices, made the business successful.

##  14. <a name='Whatarethetangibleandintangiblebenefitsinimprovingquality'></a>14. What are the tangible and intangible benefits in improving quality?

Tangible(**tan zhe bou**) benefit ：

1. Perhaps the most obvious tangible benefit of quality improvement is the reduction of costs associated(**a sou se ei ti de**) with non-quality.
2. By translating quality issues into financial measures it  facilitates(**fo sou le ti si**) senior management commitment to improvement activities and,  if sufficiently(**se dei shen li**) detailed, suggests priority areas for improvement.
3. It provides a clear indication(**in di kei shen**) of the scale(**si gai you**) of the opportunity  presented by current poor quality performance and a guide as to the  level of resources which can be committed.
4. Provides an effective measure of improvement if re-calculated after the improvement has been made.

intangible(**in tan zhe bou**) benefits：

1. Increased Customer Satisfaction
2. Increased Workforce Satisfaction and Motivation
3. Improved Environmental Impact

##  15. <a name='WhichthreemaincontributionstoqualitymanagementandqualityimprovementdescribesDEMING'></a>15. Which three main contributions to quality management and quality improvement describes DEMING?

1. Create constancy(**kang si ten sei**) of purpose for improvement of product and service.
2. Adopt the new philosophy(**fo la se fei**)
3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality.
4. End the practice of awarding business based on price tag alone.  Instead, minimize total cost by working with a single supplier.
5. Improve constantly and forever every process for planning, production, and service.
6. Institute(**in sei te tui de**) on the job training.
7. Adopt and institute leadership
8. Drive out fear
9. Break down barriers between staff areas
10. Eliminate(**in lei mei nei te**) slogans(**si lou gen si**), exhortations(**ai si hao tei shen**), and targets for the workforce
11. Eliminate numerical quotas for the workforce and numerical goals for management
12. Remove barriers that rob people of workmanship. Eliminate the annual rating or merit system.
13. Institute a vigorous(**vi ge rao si**) program of education and self-improvement for everyone
14. Put everyone in the company to work to accomplish the transformation.

##  16. <a name='WhydoweneedStandards'></a>16. Why do we need Standards?

Standards are needed to assure safety of products, to ensure that products and  materials are tailored-made for their purpose, promote the  interoperability(**in te rua pu a bi le ti**) of products and services, facilitate(**fo se le ti de**) trade by removing  trade barriers, promote common understanding of a product.

##  17. <a name='WhatdoesacertificationaccordingtoISO9000represents'></a>17. What does a certification according to ISO 9000 represents?

The main purpose of the ISO 9000 standard is to provide a time-tested  framework to help companies establish and follow a systematic approach  for managing organizational processes for rendering consistent quality.

##  18. <a name='HowitlooksthequalityprocessaccordingtoISO9000'></a>18. How it looks the quality process according to ISO 9000?

##  20. <a name='Whatisthedefinitionofqualityplanning'></a>20. What is the definition of quality planning?

“Quality planning,” as used here, is a structured process for developing products (both goods and services) that ensures that customer needs are met by the final result.

##  21. <a name='Whatisthequalityplanningproblem'></a>21. What is the quality planning problem?

1. The first component(**can pou nen te**) of the quality gap is the understanding gap, that is, lack of understanding of what the customer needs.
2. The second constituent of the quality gap is a design gap.
3. The third gap is the process gap.
4. The fourth gap is the operations gap.

##  22. <a name='Whatarethequalityplanningprocess'></a>22. What are the quality planning process?

In this step of the quality planning process, we will focus on the role of quality in product development and how that role combines with the technical aspects of development and design appropriate for a particular industry. Within product development, product design is a creative process based largely on technological or
functional expertise.

##  23. <a name='Describeeachprocesswiththreeaspects.'></a>23. Describe each process with three aspects .

**Identify Controls Needed**

​	Evaluate the actual performance of the process.
​	Compare actual performance with the goals.
​	Take action on the difference.

**Design Feedback Loop**

​	Setting the standards for control—i.e., the levels at which the process is out of control and the tools, such as control 	charts, that will be used to make the determination

​	Deciding what action is needed when those standards are not met, e.g., troubleshooting.

​	Designating who will take those actions

**Optimize Self-Control and Self-Inspection**

​	Workers know what they are doing. Their output is measured, and they receive immediate feedback on their performance.
​	Workers have the ability and the means to regulate the outcomes of the process. They need a capa-ble process along with the tools, training, and authority to regulate it.

**Audit Plan for the Transfer**

​	Goals to meet  How meeting the goals will be measured
​	The time phasing for goals, measurement, and analysis  Who will audit
​	What reports will be generated
​	Who will have responsibility for corrective action for failure to meet specific goals

**Implement Plan and Validate Transfer**

##  24. <a name='Describefollowingtoolsandtechniques'></a>24. Describe following tools and techniques

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**

The cost-benefit analysis is similar to a cost-benefit ratio. The costs and benefits are measured to analyze the
trade-offs of providing quality.

**Cost of Quality**

Cost of quality (COQ) includes all the costs that conform to the required quality of the project, including the cost to ensure conformance to requirements as well as the cost of nonconformance, and finding the right balance. Modern quality management philosophy emphasizes preventing mistakes rather than detecting them later
because the cost of nonconformance is very high.

**Cause and Effect Diagrams** P59

Cause-and-effect diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams, were developed by Kaoru Ishikawa to illustrate(**in le si tui te**) and help determine how various factors relate to potential problems. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also called fishbone diagrams because they resemble the skeleton of a fish. The head of the fish is the effect and each bone of the fish is a cause that leads to that effect. The bones can branch off into smaller bones as you determine the lowerlevel cause-effect relationships. When all the bones are filled in, the diagram lets you look at all the possible causes (individual or combinations) of the effect (or problem) so that you can develop a solution to mitigate that effect. The diagram allows organized thought and encourages orderly consideration of the factors that result in a
certain outcome.

**Flowcharts** P60

Flowcharts show the logical steps in a process and how various elements within a system are related. They can be used to determine and analyze potential problems in quality planning and quality control.
The system, or process, flowchart is probably the one that people are most familiar with. This type of flowchart outlines the logical steps to complete a process. By documenting these logical steps, the team can identify where quality problems might occur and then develop approaches to proactively manage them. Flowcharting also helps
create a process that is repeatable.

**Pareto Diagrams** P61

A Pareto chart or diagram, is a specific type of histogram that is based on Pareto’s principle, which states that a large number of defects or problems are caused by a small number of causes. Pareto’s principle, frequently referred to as the 80/20 rule or 80/20 principle. Which means that eighty percent of the cost of defects are
caused by twenty percent of the problems.

**Histograms** p61

A histogram is a vertical(**fo de kou**) bar graph that represents the frequency of each measured category (known as bins) of variable. In other words, the graph represents a rough frequency distribution of the data. The histogram is particularly useful for identifying common causes. The histogram can be ordered, similar to a Pareto chart, or
unordered.

**Network Diagrams**

The network diagram is a schematic(**si ge mai ti ke**) display of the logical relationships, or interdependencies, of all the project activities. You can create it manually or with a project management software tool. The network diagram is a
good tool to show the workflow of the project and it can help effectively plan and organize the project.

**Quality Audit**

One of the most important sub processes performed during the quality assurance process is the quality audit. According to the PMBOK Guide, the quality audit is an independent review conducted by internal or external auditors. The quality audit can be performed on a regularly scheduled basis or an ad hoc basis. The audit is a structured review of quality management activities to identify good or best practices and lessons learned for use
on current or future projects.

##  25. <a name='BusinessModelswithLeanStartUpApproachandDesignThinking'></a>25. Business Models with Lean StartUp Approach and Design Thinking

![image-20220506210841403](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77034643/167244769-d4dfb751-a138-432d-95dd-4fe6b28cc8bc.png)

• Digitalisation(**di er gou lai zei shen**) raises lots of different business ideas and opportunities(**a pu tui ne ti si**). • Successful making use of digitalisation involves therefore to filter out those ideas that allow for exploiting the emerging business opportunities.
• Lean Startup Approach and Design Thinking Approach are two different ways that allow for filtering efficiently and effectively and to build a business model.
• Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses – which one is applied depends on the
situation (e.g. whether a founder is visionary or a problem-solver etc.).

##  26. <a name='WhatisanIntegratedManagementSystemIMS'></a>26. What is an Integrated Management System (IMS)?

The introduction of an Integrated(**in te ge rui di de**) Management System (IMS) follows this management process: analysis, planning, realization and control. This means that the framework conditions must be analyzed for the introduction of an IMS,
the steps for its introduction planned, and then implemented and controlled.

The term "Integrated Management Systems" refers to the close interaction of the individual MS.
Integrative MS connect different MS with each other:
